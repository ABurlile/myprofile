				<h3>More About Me</h3>
					<p>I was born in raised in Idaho and the wonderful outdoor recreation opportunities are a huge part of what has kept me and my family in this great state. 
				   I moved here to Boise 13 years ago to study Business Management. After years working in childcare, real estate, banking and most recently, 
				   owning my own successful childcare business, I was ready for a change. Learning to be a web developer has been a goal of mine for several years and I couldn't be more 
				   excited about achieving that goal and becoming a web developer.
